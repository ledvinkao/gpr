# Mathematical operations with vector geodata geometry --------------------

# a geometry column of vector geodata is in fact of class list
# so we can do mathematical operations with it, such as addition or multiplication
# this property can be useful e.g. when systematically shifting points a few meters/kilometers in any direction

# let us demonstrate while using metadata from the Air Quality Section of the CHMI
# (can be retrieved at https://opendata.chmi.cz/air_quality/historical/)

# load necessary packages

                  "tmap")

# not to delay, we have the metadata (state to March 2025) already prepared in an Apache Parquet file airquality_metadata_pq
# Apache Parquet files can be treated like SQL databases
# establish a pointer to the file
